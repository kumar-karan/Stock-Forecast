# Project Overview

This project aims to predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index using machine learning techniques.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download historical data using the `yfinance` package.
   
2. **Initial Model Development**: Create a baseline machine learning model and evaluate its accuracy.
   
3. **Backtesting Engine**: Develop a backtesting engine to rigorously assess the model's performance over different time periods.
   
4. **Model Refinement**: Improve the model's accuracy through iterative refinement and parameter tuning.

### File Overview:

- **`market_prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing all project code.
